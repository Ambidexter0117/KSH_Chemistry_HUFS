Electrochemistry is the branch of physical chemistry that studies
the relationship between electricity, a
s a measurable and quantitative phenomenon
, and identifiable chemical change, with eit
her electricity considered an outcome of a pa
rticular chemical change or vice versa. These
reactions involve electric charges moving betwe
en electrodes and an electrolyte (or ionic specie
s in a solution). Thus electrochemistry deals with
 the interaction between electrical energy and chemical change.
When a chemical reaction is caused by an e
xternally supplied current, as in electro
ysis, or if an electric current is produced by a
 spontaneous chemical reaction as in a battery, it is
  called an electrochemical reaction. Chemical reactions where
   electrons are transferred directly between molecules and/or atom
   s are called oxidation-reduction or redox reactions. In general, electroc
   hemistry describes the overall reactions when individual redox reactions are s
   eparate but connected by an external electric circuit and an intervening electrolyte.
