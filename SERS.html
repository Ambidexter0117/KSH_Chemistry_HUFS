SERS from pyridine adsorbed on electrochemically
 roughened silver was first observed by Martin
  Fleischmann, Patrick J. Hendra and A. James
   McQuillan at the Department of Chemistry at
    the University of Southampton, UK in 1973.[6]
    This initial publication has been cited over
     4000 times. The 40th Anniversary of the fi
     rst observation of the SERS effect has been
     marked by the Royal Society of Chemistry by
      the award of a National Chemical Landmark p
laque to the University of Southampton.
In 1977, two groups independently noted that the concentration of scattering species could not account for the enhanced signal and each proposed a
  mechanism for the observed enhancement.
  Their theories are still accepted as explaining the SERS effect. Jeanmaire and Richard Van Duyne[7] proposed an electromagnetic effect, while Albrecht and Creighton[8] proposed a charge-transfer effect. Rufus Ritchie, of Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Health Sciences Research Division, predicted the existence of the surface plasmon
